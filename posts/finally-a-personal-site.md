I woke up in the middle of night from a dream - no, a vision - of a website where a web developer could write their musings on work and life.
It was such an unimaginably original idea that I had to get started immediately. I sat down at my computer, opened Reddit, and forgot about it completely.

Anyways this is a Next.js tutorial project that got out of hand.
