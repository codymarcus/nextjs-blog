I was never much of a bike rider. Like most Canadians, I learned how to ride one as a rite of passage as a kid, then forgot about them as a teenager (with the exception of an ill-fated mountain biking field trip).

It wasn't until I moved out of the U of T dorms and into an apartment that was about 20 minutes away from campus that I started thinking about bikes again. After an intoxicated ride on my roommate's bike I knew that I had to take the plunge. I bought a Giant Escape hybrid in 2014.

Once you have a bike you realize it's by far the best way to commute in a city. Transit in Toronto is generally unreliable and frustrating, while driving costs a lot of money and comes with parking requirements. Cycling gives you freedom and speed at a relatively low one-time cost.

Fast-forward a few years and I was going on longer leisure rides with friends, up and down the longer trails around Toronto. I recognized that my hybrid was forcing me to put in more work than their road and cross bikes. Everything seemed so much more effortless and smooth on a road bike. So, in the summer of 2019 I picked up my first road bike, a Specialized Allez.

The Allez is widely considered as one of the best entry-level road bikes. Funny how an entry-level aluminum road bike with 8 gears costs as much as a high-end hybrid. The difference was real though, pedaling felt insanely smooth and it was as though I was only pushing myself forward, not me plus a bike.

It was at this point that I started watching GCN (Global Cycling Network) videos on YouTube. GCN is kind of like Top Gear for cycling. A bunch of cheeky Brits doing crazy cycling challenges and showing off bikes and equipment. I was also introduced to a friend of a friend who was getting into more serious cycling. I started going down the rabbit hole of cycling as a sport.

I bought cycling clothes, sensors, a cycling computer, and clipless pedals. I got on Strava and was constantly comparing my times to friends and strangers alike. A couple years ago I'd never have imagined I'd be going over 60km/h on a bike with just a helmet for protection but there I was. In my search for new routes I discovered parts of Toronto that I had never seen. I always leaned towards trails over roads despite the obstructions (ie people) that they were filled with.

As winter started creeping up I picked up an indoor trainer in order to keep the addiction going. At that point I started getting into the numbers even more. FTP (functional threshold power) is the number one metric when it comes to cycling fitness. Now that I had plopped my bike onto a trainer I was able to measure my power output. I started using Zwift, which is a video gamey training app where you control a character in a virtual world as you do training plans and races. After completing a Zwift training plan I switched to TrainerRoad, which has a more serious reputation. There's no games or characters, just a bar graph of expected power output and instructional/motivational captions.

Completing TrainerRoad plans resulted in my FTP rising significantly, and I was starting to look into (outdoor) racing. I would need more experience riding in packs since drafting is one of the most important parts of racing. In early 2020 I began investigating local cycling clubs with group rides in anticipation of spring. Then, as we all know, Covid hit the world and everything shut down. Club riding and racing was out of the question.

I continued riding outdoors but lost some motivation. The momentum of my cycling journey had been halted. The logical next step was unavailable and the excitement of discovering new routes was dying off as I had already covered most of what was in Toronto. I bought a new carbon bike, a Specialized Tarmac, with the hope that it would reinvigorate the passion, but after a honeymoon period it was just more of the same.

These days I still ride on and off the trainer, but not nearly as frequently as before. Hopefully once Covid dies down I'll be able to get a taste of group riding and possibly racing.
